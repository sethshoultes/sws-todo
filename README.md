# SWS Todo React App

## 🎯 Project Origin

This project began with a simple yet powerful Bolt prompt:

```
Create a todo app with the following features:
- User authentication
- Todo CRUD operations
- Folder organization
- Sharing capabilities
- Real-time updates
- Offline support
```

From this initial prompt, Bolt AI developed a comprehensive, production-ready application with advanced features like granular permissions, real-time collaboration, and PWA capabilities. The entire development process was guided by AI, demonstrating the power of AI-driven development.

A revolutionary collaborative todo application developed entirely through AI-driven development, guided by Seth Shoultes ([@sethshoultes](https://github.com/sethshoultes)).
